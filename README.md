# Crime Data Analysis and Prediction
This was the final project of "Urban Technology" course of my Master's study. San Francisco Crime dataset from kaggle was selected for this project. Exploratory Data Analysis and prediction of the severity of the crime using different machine learning methods were done. Please, go through the project presentation for a detailed summary on the project and feel free to use the notebooks as reference if you want to work on a similar kind of project.
